        <li> Overall, this assignment wasn't very challenging to me. I did run
            <br> into a few small inconvieniences such as trying to break up my long
            <br> run-on lines into smaller more appealing ones, as well as an issue
            <br> with resizing my picture because it was taking up the whole screen.
            <br> I worked through these minor issues by finding basic html commands
            <br> online and implementing them throughout my code. </li>
        <li> I learned how to format words as well as insert & size pictures. </li>
        <li> I used a website called computerhope.com which provided me with
            <br> small code fragments that guided me through the issues I faced. </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li> It is really funny to me to admit this, but the most challenging part
            <br> of this assignment was figuring out how to change the "Benny's List"
            <br> title. I kept attempting to change the font, color, size, etc., but
            <br> regardless of what class I called to insert the code into, no changes
            <br> were being made. Once I figured out the correct code to make these
            <br> changes, I was all set with everything. </li>
        <li> I learned a lot regarding how to format using CSS. </li>
        <li> I used the lectures as well as the CSS file on GitHub to complete the
            <br> assignment, I felt like I gained alot of insight through viewing
            <br> the example code within the CSS files and applying them myself. </li>
        <li> I didn't google much because I used the CSS file, but I did google to
            <br> find script regarding hovering as well as modifying text decoration.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li> For me personally, the most challenging part about this assignment was
            <br> figuring out how to start, I myself have never coded in javascript
            <br> prior to this assignment, and so syntax was what I struggled with
            <br> the most. When I learned how to first code, I began with languages
            <br> such as MatLab as well as C++, therefore javascript felt completely
            <br> foreign until I had gotten the hang of it. </li>
        <li> I learned so much regarding javascript and storing user data. </li>
        <li> I used the lectures as well as help from the TA's to complete the
            <br> assignment, I felt like I gained alot of insight through viewing
            <br> the example code within the lectures and applying them myself. </li>
        <li> I didn't google much because I used the TA's, lectures, as well as help
            <br> from Piazza, but I did google syntax for things I was unfamiliar with.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li> The most challenging part of this assignment was getting a grasp on
            <br> the handlebars and express-handlebars process, I was struggling
            <br> with figuring out how to install them onto my coding program and
            <br> figure out how to implement the templates in my code correctly.
            <br> Once I eventually figured out how to use handlebars, I was able
            <br> to templatize my program and understand the concept of it.
        </li>
        <li> I learned so much regarding implementing templates within a program
            <br> it makes alot of sense why templates are used for web development.
            <br> Prior to this course, I assumed that these websites were hard coded
            <br> repeatedly without any templates to aid in the process. Templatizing
            <br> is a very smart way to make code efficient and clearer to understand.
        </li>
        <li> Obviously, learning this assignment was a struggle given the fact that
            <br> our remaining lecture time had to unfortunately get cut short. But
            <br> I was able to learn alot by simply following along with the lectures
            <br> and applying the same steps as I was templatizing my own program.
        </li>
        <li> I didn't feel the need to google much because I used the TA's, lecture
            <br> videos, as well as help from Piazza, but I did google the installation
            <br> guide as well as syntax for downloading handlebars and express-handlebars.
        </li>
    </ul>
